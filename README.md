# NPS
## <nlw /> edition # 04

#### NPS stands for Net Promoter Score which in a direct translation means ‚ÄúAverage referral score‚Äù.
#### The purpose of this analysis is to find out if there are more people indicating or speaking badly about your product and service. 
#### A brand with negative NPS has a great chance of having very low growth or having to invest a lot to grow.
